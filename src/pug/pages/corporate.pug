The second component of the antibody test is crucial in order to understand if your employee has previously had the virus of not. Thus, helping identify those who may have been “silent carriers”. 
                    |Scientific research is ongoing into whether previous infections signify that the person has developed a potential immunity to the virus. At this stage, scientific consensus continues to be that immunity remains unconfirmed.
